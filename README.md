# Description

Hermes provides a real-time chatting platform for multiple users. It allows users to create an account, login, and chat with other users online. The chat application uses a client-server architecture, where the client is developed using PyQt6 and the server is developed using Python's gRPC library.

The application's graphical user interface (GUI) is developed using PyQt6, a popular Python framework for developing desktop applications. The server-side logic is developed using gRPC, which is an open-source remote procedure call (RPC) framework that simplifies the development of microservices.

The database used for this project is MongoDB which stores the authentication detail about the users.
